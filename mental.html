        <p class="aboutus"> About Us: <br>
          Ovar-looked is a group of open-minded individuals with a close and personal connection to PCOS.
          Our aim is to raise awareness about Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome as it is one of the most forgotten but important syndromes that affect women worldwide.
          We want to provide a platform where young women and men can educate themselves about the syndrome:
          This entials learning about physical, mental, and nutritional health surrounding PCOS, discovering statistics, and connecting to the PCOS community via chat and comment features.
          Our platform may also be used as a tool to receive tips, suggestions and help from other individuals suffering from PCOS.     </p>
